uid-3,"Election? Here's How You Do It, Mate.","From our downunder perspective here in Australia, the United States is all about choice. Everywhere you look, there are so many options. The huge variety of breakfast cereals in the average American supermarket is enough to make me feel like I've just escaped the Soviet Union circa 1958. It's the same with your presidential politics; the spectrum of candidates and political ideologies you have to choose from is positively dazzling.</br></br>By contrast, Aussie politicians mostly tend to follow the Henry Ford principle, slightly modified: ""Any color you like, as long as it's beige.""</br></br>We recently had an election here, and the whole thing was like that, pretty beige. We had precisely two candidates, and they were barely distinguishable, except that one headed the Liberal Party (the main conservative group) and the other was the candidate of Labor (founded by the union movement). Our entire federal election campaign lasted exactly six weeks -- a long slog, according to pundits and voters alike. After a month, most people were moaning, ""I just want it to be over!""</br></br>So you can see why, to us Aussies, your two-year process, from candidate announcements to Inauguration Day, might seem a tad excessive. If not downright, well, absurd.</br></br>This past summer in Iowa, I had the chance to size up most of the current crop of U.S. presidential candidates, and I had to wonder how on Earth you're going to choose from this most diverse field ever of would-be presidents. Gadding about the Hawkeye State, I saw Rudy Giuliani and John McCain working the crowd with one-liners, Bill Richardson cornering people in dark alleys at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, and Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Biden explaining how the six or seven candidates ahead of them in the polls were going to crash and burn just like Howard Dean in 2004."
uid-4,The Biggest Boom Ever,"We are about to rewrite history. Unless a recession begins in the next few days, this boom will soon become the longest in the American experience. In February, it will have lasted 107 months. The current record is 106 months between February 1961 and December 1969, according to the dating of business cycles by the National Bureau of Economic Research. By and large, Americans are behaving as if recessions are a relic of the past, even though everyone must realize that the boom will end someday--and might end badly.</br></br>As with all records, people will celebrate and assert bragging rights. President Clinton always claims credit and will almost certainly repeat the claims in tomorrow's State of the Union. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is idolized for his presumed role. The murkier truth is that the boom's causes remain obscure and, to the extent they can be identified, reflect a protracted and largely nonpolitical process.</br></br>Low inflation has been the critical catalyst. In the past, rising inflation has doomed expansions through higher interest rates, increased labor costs and squeezed profits. Consumer spending, housing construction and business investment all suffered. Yet, inflation now remains tame. By various measures, it's running between 1 percent and slightly more than 2 percent a year. This is lower than in 1990 (between 4 percent and 6 percent by the same measures) and defies the conventional tendency of inflation to worsen as the economy ""heats up."" * The Fed: Paul Volcker, chairman of the Fed between 1979 and 1987, crushed inflationary expectations. In the 1960s and 1970s, these had become ingrained. Companies raised prices because they expected customers would pay. Workers expected pay raises to compensate for higher prices--and then some. The Fed blessed the process by creating more money. Its permissive policies rested on the prevailing--but faulty--theory that a bit of inflation aided economic growth. By 1980 inflation had reached double digits. Volcker tightened money, increased interest rates and caused a savage recession. In 1982 unemployment neared 11 percent. Though brutal, the downturn stifled wage and price increases. By 1983 inflation was 4 percent. President Reagan sanctioned Volcker's policy by muting criticism. Since then, Greenspan's Fed has pursued ""price stability"" and has raised interest rates (as in 1994) to prevent inflation's upward creep. Presidents Bush and Clinton have emulated Reagan's self- restraint.</br></br>* Better Management: Through the 1970s, corporate managers were rarely fired. Their job tenure rivaled university professors'. In the 1980s, things changed. Managers became vulnerable to job loss for many reasons: the recession; foreign competition; deregulation in the airline, trucking and communications industries; ""hostile"" corporate takeovers; the growth of new discounters (Wal-Mart, Home Depot). Self- preservation made managers more ruthless. They cut costs to raise profits. Old plants were shut. Layoffs and ""downsizings"" became common. Again, the immediate consequences were often cruel and (as with Volcker's recession) widely deplored. But the lasting effect was less inflationary behavior.</br></br>* New Technology: As everyone knows, business investment in computers and communications has exploded. The presumption is that these investments enable companies to do things faster and cheaper-- they raise ""productivity."" Firms can minimize unneeded inventories or speed the processing of customer orders. Higher productivity can be magical. If a company improves productivity 3 percent, it can raise wages 3 percent without increasing prices or sacrificing profits. And productivity has improved. In recent years, it's approached 3 percent a year, up from 1.6 percent in the 1980s."
uid-5,Economic Aide Sees Uptrend,"Sedate and scholarly Dr. Arthur Burns, the ex-Columbia professor, now chief of Presi dent Eisenhower�۪s Council of Economic A d -j visers, went to great pains in explaining to Senators why he had to testify about business recession in secret.</br></br>Dr- Burns, appearing before _ the Joint Committee on the = Economic Report, explained | = that he had been searching his E soul as to whether to testify at'Si all. The way he looked at it. he had a confidential relationship with the President. However, he had given the matter deep thought. Since Cabinet officers are expected to testify, Burns decided he, too. had an obliga tion to appear before Congress if requested. However, he had to insist that no transcript be taken of his remarks of native troops. Radford proposes sending a top United States military man, with experience in either Greece or Korea, to train Indo-Chinese natives.</br></br>This would save French lives, and, he believes, would result in some real resistance against the Chinese-equipped Communists who' since the end of the Korean war have received trainload after trainload of munitions, obviously diverted from the Korean front.</br></br>Sen. Paul Douglas (D-I1L), an ex-professor of economics at the University of Chicago, promptly challenged him. Burns then went into a lengthy explanation, pointing out that in speaking off-the-cuff, he was apt to oversimplify a complex situation or to state an idea more positively than it ought to be expressed. Therefore, he preferred to keep his remarkg informal. If a transcript were made, he said, it would make his testimony appear more formal than it actually would be.</br></br>There was also the possibility, he continued, that he might say something that would appear to be in contradiction of . the President�۪s Economic Report. He hastened to assure that he didn�۪t mean he disagreed with the President�۪s report in any detail. But in the course of speaking, he said, some statement of his might come out on the record that would appear to contradict the President. If that happened, lie added solemnly, and his remark were made permanent in transcript form, he would feel constrained to resign, within the hour.	,"
uid-6,Manager's Journal: Sniffing Out Drug Abusers Is No Quick Fix,"The statistics on the enormous costs of employee drug abuse are well known (at least $70 billion per year, according to December 1985 testimony before the House Labor Subcommittee on Health and Safety). Management is under pressure to reduce productivity losses, turnover, insurance costs and the risk of lawsuits for personal and property damage caused by drug-impaired workers. Management also is under sales pressure from a growing cadre of laboratories, test-kit manufacturers and consultants who extol the virtues of testing. A common argument is the following: ""Your competitors are starting to require drug tests. If you don't, their work force will be clean and you will end up with all the junkies.""</br></br>Many companies that have implemented widespread drug-testing programs, however, have learned that there is a downside to testing. They have experienced the protests of employees and civil libertarians and have watched the proliferation of lawsuits alleging invasion of privacy, defamation and other legal theories. A Texas railroad employee was awarded $200,000 in damages when his employer misreported the results of a drug test. Numerous other cases are pending.</br></br>Is there a middle ground? Can safety and efficiency be protected without invading the privacy of applicants and employees?</br></br>A growing number of companies have concluded that drug testing should be the least important part of a comprehensive drug-abuse program. The starting point is a drug-awareness program to educate managers, supervisors and employees about the dangers and signs of drug abuse. The second part of the program is an effective employee-assistance program (EAP). Rehabilitation is preferable to punishment or dismissal (at least for initial or nonserious offenses) because it encourages employees to seek help voluntarily, improves labor relations and is cost-effective by restoring valuable employees to productive status. More than one company that heedlessly adopted a ""screen and fire"" policy on drugs had second thoughts after discovering traces of drugs in some of their most productive employees.</br></br>There may be a place for drug testing in a company's drug-abuse program, but there are limits to the effectiveness of testing. To begin with, the accuracy of some drug tests varies widely, and the test results are often unacceptable even when performed by professional laboratories. Last year the Centers for Disease Control published the results of a 10-year study of laboratory testing for amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, codeine, methadone and morphine. Virtually all of the laboratories in the study had unacceptably high error rates."

That's slightly higher than the 3% and 3.6% consensus forecasts from Blue Chip Economic Indicators.</br></br>Still, the overall drop in the jobless rate set off alarms at the Federal Reserve, which remains worried that desperate employers will boost wages and benefits to attract or retain workers, triggering inflation. The Fed has raised interest rates six times since June 1999 to slow the economy, though it has kept rates steady at its past three meetings.</br></br>Many analysts said that before raising rates again this year, the central bank would have to see a similar decline in next month's jobs data, alongside a clearer indication that labor costs were rising."

""There will be people who say tax reform caused the market drop,"" says Joseph Minarik, an economist at the Urban Institute, ""but that's ridiculous.""</br></br>Indeed, whatever the ultimate effects of the market's plunge, it will probably serve to reinforce the basic lesson of the past 12 months: that the economic impact of even radical tax changes can easily be overwhelmed by other events."
uid-15,It's Too Early to Put GE's Welch In the Managers Hall of Fame,"One of the big problems that most of us have in life is that we never get to read our own obituaries, which would be our best chance to see people saying nice things about us. But high-profile corporate chieftains who announce their departures don't have this problem. They get to hear all that nice stuff while they're still around, because retirement stories strongly resemble obits, except that the subject is still alive and kicking. As witness the gushing and slobbering over General Electric Co. Chairman Jack Welch last week after he mentioned on a TV show that he plans to retire in April 2001. Welch would then be 65, and he would have had a nice, round 20 years at the helm of GE.</br></br>Welch, the highest-profile corporate manager in the world--not to be confused with Microsoft Corp.'s Bill Gates, who's a founder, not merely a manager--is one of those people who make you feel good about subscribing to the Great Man Theory of business: the idea that one person can make a huge difference. No matter how much of Welch's success you ascribe to historical forces and luck--the economy was dead in the water, with interest rates at 20 percent, when he took over, and it is roaring ahead now--it's clear that a good part of what's happened at GE since Welch took over in 1981 must have a lot to do with the man and the people he picked as subordinates. GE's stock price has risen from $4.18 3/4 (adjusted for four stock splits) on March 31, 1981, the day before he took over, to $134 yesterday. That 3,100 percent increase is more than triple the 900 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index during that period. GE stock has risen 20.5 percent a year, compounded, compared with 13.2 for the S&P.</br></br>But even as the encomiums pile up for Welch, known as ""Neutron Jack"" in his younger days for vaporizing jobs while leaving buildings intact, it's time to play my traditional role as skunk at the garden party. Welch is clearly very, very, very good. But as effective as his leadership has been in helping GE transform itself from an old- line industrial company into a sleek, finance-oriented conglomerate, it's not yet clear how good a manager Welch is. How can I say that? Because picking a worthy successor is one of the most vital elements of managing. Since we don't know who Welch's successor is or how worthy he (all the leading candidates are men) will prove to be, I think it's too early to call Welch a management god.</br></br>This may sound like nitpicking, but please bear with me. Consider, if you will, what's happened to Coca-Cola Co. since the charismatic and wonderfully well-regarded Roberto Goizueta died in 1997. He was on the same level as Welch in the business pantheon. But Goizueta's handpicked successor, Douglas Ivester, has had nothing but trouble since taking over the Coke chairmanship. Similar fates have befallen the people who succeeded two other well-regarded, visionary corporate chieftains: Charles Lazarus, who retired as Toys R Us Inc. chief executive in 1994, and Anthony O'Reilly, who retired from H.J. Heinz Co. last year. Lazarus and O'Reilly were good leaders--but not, in my humble opinion, good managers. It's a bad reflection on them that their successors all seem to have had feet of clay. Hmm. It makes you wonder whether these guys were really as good as they seemed to be when they left office. And whether they'd have had trouble if they'd stayed around.</br></br>Why does this matter? Because it's important to keep perspective and not get swept away by conventional wisdom. Reporting about the personalities and peccadilloes of corporate managers has in large part replaced reporting about the corporations they run--both in the media world and on Wall Street. That's partly because people are generally more interesting than companies, partly because they're easier to analyze."

Another positive factor was a climate that is, believe it or not, considered relatively benign.</br></br>But when three economists-Mark Berger and Glenn Blomquist at the University of Kentucky and John Hoehn at Michigan State University-measured a different set of quality-of-life indicators in what they say is a less subjective fashion, the District did considerably poorer: 155th. That's behind such places as Lubbock, Tex., Erie, Pa., and Atlantic County, N.J., home of Atlantic City.</br></br>Part of the reasons for the difference in D.C.'s score, the economists say, lies in how a community is perceived. When a decision is made to relocate, relatively few people are influenced by the presence of major medical centers, a university or even cultural attractions. Factors such as climate, the quality of secondary schools and the crime rate are much more significant in deciding between cities or even certain parts of one city.</br></br>In other words, it's nice to have the Smithsonian here, but would you pay more for your housing or take a cut in salary because of it? Probably not, although the economists argue that is what the Places Rated ranking implies. On the other hand, the trio places a good deal of emphasis on crime rates, which are a major influence when choosing a city or neighborhood."

uid-19,Manager's journal: America's corporations should swear off pork,"Earlier this month an ad appeared in this newspaper entitled ""Declaration of Independence: End Corporate Welfare."" It was signed by 61 top Silicon Valley executives, including me. In calling for government to end corporate pork-barrel politics, we were taking a moral stand.</br></br>The first Americans hated taxes; the Constitution limited government and, originally, banned levies on personal income. For the first two centuries of our nation, the common man became better off more quickly than any other time in history. Per capita U.S. gross domestic product grew to $28,540 in 1996 from just $919 (in 1996 dollars) in 1776. Mankind took 30,000 years to get to $919, but only 220 more years to reach $28,540. But today the American Dream is being eroded. Since 1976 annual GDP growth per capita (expressed as a 20-year rolling average) has steadily declined, to 1.5% from 2.5%. Why? In part because federal, state and local taxes now consume a whopping 35% of our national output. Current peacetime spending is higher than the 29% peak during World War I; the all-time record was 49% during World War II.</br></br>American companies should lead in the reduction of destructive government spending. Eliminating corporate welfare is a moral imperative: We should not be asking senior citizens and the poor to tighten their belts while our government is, actually subsidizes the sale of American chardonnay to the French.</br></br>Taxing and spending to support U.S. industry creates a vicious circle. With corporate taxes high, companies lobby for give-backs to remain competitive. Congress faces extreme pressure to ""bring home the pork"" to home-state corporations. That requires even higher taxes -- and the circle continues.</br></br>Corporate subsidies are often known by euphemisms such as ""government investments"" or ""government-industry partnerships.""

uid-23,Rein In Fannie Mae -- Before It's Too Late,"The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Fannie Mae has threatened several large financial services firms that had opposed Fannie's interests in Congress. According to statements by the CEOs of AIG, Wells Fargo and GE Capital Services, they, or their firms, were told that Fannie would withdraw its business from them if they remained active in FM Watch, an organization that seeks to limit Fannie's expansion beyond its traditional role in the secondary mortgage markets. Fannie's chairman Franklin Raines, as well as a Fannie spokeswoman, have both denied that such threats were made, but when CEOs of major companies go public with statements of this gravity they must be taken seriously.</br></br>This is not an ordinary commercial dispute, since Fannie Mae is not an ordinary company. Along with its smaller cousin, Freddie Mac, Fannie enjoys a government charter authorizing it to help create liquidity in the residential mortgage markets by purchasing mortgages from banks and others and guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities. Although both Fannie and Freddie are now listed on the New York Stock Exchange, they have so many links to government -- including a special line of credit at the Treasury -- that they are called government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs.</br></br>As a result, the capital markets do not believe they will be allowed to fail, and provide them with financing at a rate only slightly higher than the Treasury's own borrowing costs. With this government backing and financial advantage, Fannie and Freddie have grown to enormous size and profitability. Today, they carry on their books the credit risk of over 40% of all residential mortgages in the U.S. and are by far the most dominant players in the residential mortgage markets. It is fair to say that if a company is denied the opportunity to sell its mortgages to Fannie or Freddie, or the opportunity to underwrite or deal in Fannie or Freddie securities, it will suffer serious financial harm.</br></br>If Mr. Raines or Fannie did threaten these companies, that is the reason why his threat was menacing. Fannie Mae is to the residential mortgage markets what Microsoft is to computers, with one major exception: Fannie enjoys government backing. Fannie's market power derives from its government connection -- from the fact that it holds, in effect, a government monopoly. A threat from Fannie's chairman, then, is roughly equivalent to the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board threatening to ruin a bank that opposes the Fed in Congress. Such a threat would be seen as a serious matter, out of order for a government official and considerably more serious than the threats that Microsoft is alleged to have made against rivals.</br></br>This episode should alert us to dangers inherent in GSEs. They are sometimes praised as providing private-sector efficiency in the pursuit of government policies, without direct government expenditure. Unfortunately, the true costs are hidden or deferred. In the mid-1980s, Congress had to spend billions to bail out the Farm Credit System, another GSE. And the costs are often not simply financial. While we value the aggressiveness and efficiencies of private enterprises in their pursuit of profit, when these characteristics are hitched to the power of the government through a government-granted monopoly, they can dominate and distort otherwise competitive markets."

uid-25,The Dismal Science: The Best Way to Give Business a Boost,"Today, the Bush administration and Congress will start squinting their collective eyes at a bunch of proposals to cut taxes on business. They are responding to the fact that the current economic weakness started back with a steep fall-off in business investment. That fall-off has likely accelerated after Sept. 11, and their hope is to produce a tax package that will encourage capital spending.</br></br>The two hottest ideas at the moment are speeding up depreciation on plant and equipment, as well as a cut in the corporate income tax rate. Both are sensible for establishing conditions for economic growth, although both ideas could be improved upon:</br></br>-- Faster depreciation or, even better, immediate expensing.</br></br>Currently, business investment cannot be fully expensed in the year it is made, but must be depreciated over time. Depending on asset class, that time can be anywhere from several years to almost three decades. This delay leaves the value of the write-off exposed to twin evils: losses in the time value of money (a dollar in hand is worth more than a dollar promised) and losses due to inflation. If, however, businesses could write-off the entire value of a capital investment in the year it is undertaken -- expense the investment -- the erosion and risk associated with long depreciation schedules would disappear.</br></br>If immediate expensing weren't possible, even faster depreciation would reduce those dangers. Either way, capital investment would look more attractive to business and, accordingly, more such investment would be undertaken. This could be the start of a virtuous cycle in which more capital formation increases labor productivity that, in turn, raises wages."

Also at work is hie fact that several years of accelerating price increases for practically everything, from candy bars to cars, have deeply changed Americans' expectations about the economy. Specifically, what most people now expect are ever higher price tags, and, in economic matters, that has a way of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.</br></br>Thus the experts may argue about whether inflation will be two-digit or one, whether wholesale prices will rise less rapidly than retail quotes, whether inflation may slow somewhat in the fourth quarter. But most of this is lost on consumers. They see more inflation, and they act on what they see.</br></br>More affluent citizens have reacted by scrambling to invest in anything that looks like it might be an inflation ���hedge,�۝ something whose value hopefully would rise more rapidly than prices of everything else.

If the treatments work as intended, banks should resume lending at least to each other, a necessary step toward recovery.</br></br>The new U.S. plan ""is going to boost confidence that the most extreme downside risks have been diminished, but the damage has been done, and this isn't going to prevent the economy from being in recession and remaining weak for a while,"" Laurence Meyer, an economic forecaster and former Federal Reserve governor, said Tuesday. Exactly."

uid-46,"Senate Passes Banking Bill, Paving Way for Overhaul; House Backers Trying to Push Through Similar Measure","The Senate yesterday approved a bill that could pave the way for the most comprehensive overhaul of federal banking law in 50 years, giving banks and securities firms broad authority to venture into each others' businesses.</br></br>The legislation, which passed by a vote of 94 to 2, would gradually tear down barriers between banks and securities firms and force banks and other financial service companies to spell out in simple English the costs and potential interest income of checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit and other products banks sell to the public.</br></br>The obstacle to the banking legislation has been the House, where opponents in the securities and the savings-and-loan industries have had a powerful ally in House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand J. St Germain (D-R.I.). Although the Senate passed banking deregulation legislation once before, in 1984, the House has never done so.</br></br>However, a growing block of House Democrats is attempting to bypass St Germain, seeking support for legislation similar to the Senate-passed package.</br></br>Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, which has jurisdiction over securities law, is allowing himself ""to be dragged kicking and screaming"" to the side of those supporting the Senate legislation, sources said. Dingell has been opposed to banking deregulation in the past."
uid-47,Dow Industrials Flirt With Peak On Latest Climb,"THE DOW JONES Industrial Average bypassed its high within minutes of the market open, then again near the close, but trimmed its gains to finish shy of the record.</br></br>The indicator, which tracks 30 blue-chip companies, posted an intraday high of 11728.46, up 5.48 points from its January 2000 peak. But on the day, the Dow industrials finished up 29.21 points, or 0.29%, at 11718.45, up 9.3% on the year.</br></br>Among the Dow average's strongest components were Caterpillar and General Motors. GM rose after Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda, which owns 9.9% of GM's shares outstanding, said it was considering purchasing as many as 12 million more shares of the auto maker. Tracinda also said it supports an alliance between GM and Renault-Nissan.</br></br>However, the three names with the biggest influence weightings in the price-weighted Dow industrial average -- International Business Machines, Altria Group and Boeing -- all finished the day off less than 0.5%. Even modest gains at one or two of those companies would have sent the Dow industrial average over its record, which now stands just 4.53 points away, at 11722.98.</br></br>""The Dow is teasing everybody right now,"" said Kenneth Tower, chief market strategist at the online-brokerage firm CyberTrader."
uid-48,"How the Recovery Went Wrong; Of the 11 recoveries in the last 60 years, this one is at or near the bottom in job growth and every other economic indicator.","President Obama, in speech after speech, proudly makes the following point: Although we inherited the worst recession since the Great Depression, we have generated net new jobs every month, and while we need to do more, we are going in the right direction.</br></br>Of course, recoveries always go in the right direction--that is, things get better over time. But merely going in the right direction is an incredibly low performance standard. Moreover, since deep recessions are generally followed by more robust recoveries, this should have been one of the strongest recoveries ever.</br></br>So what went wrong? All the available Keynesian levers for achieving economic growth have been pulled, yet the recovery is one of the weakest since World War II. The problem lies with the way the ""stimulus"" was carried out, the uncertainty of looming higher taxes, and the antibusiness rhetoric and regulatory strong-arming of this administration.</br></br>First, exactly how weak has this recovery been? The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis tracks economic performance for each recovery and compares gross-domestic-product growth and job growth, the two most important indicators of economic performance. Over the past 60 years, there have been 11 recessions and 11 recoveries.</br></br>Sadly, this recovery is near the bottom of all 11. Cumulative nonfarm job growth is just 1.9% 34 months into recovery, the ninth-worst performance and well below the average job growth of 6.5%. Cumulative GDP growth is just 6.8% 11 quarters into this recovery, less than half the average (15.2%) and the worst of all 11."

""But there is a question whether American religiosity is strong enough. It appears to be, from the Vatican point of view, content-free, more spiritual high and emotion than a serious question as to what is true and what is not."""
uid-50,Lamb Chop,"MEMBERS OF Congress, who set their own pay, are caught between weaknesses. They want-and, we think, are entitled to-higher pay than they have the courage to vote for. Their way of choosing between the unpleasant alternatives over the years has been not to choose but to resort to subterfuge. The slipperiness of the system has become worse than the reality it is meant to hide.</br></br>The latest example has to do with a vote that Congress took in 1954 to forgive itself some taxes. It adopted a provision, still in effect, allowing each member to deduct as business expenses up to $3,000 a year of living expenses here in Washington. Inflation, of course, has greatly eroded the value of the deduction. In the House Ways and Means Committee, which is considering a bill to make ""technical corrections"" to the code, proposals have been made to lift and even remove the ceiling on the deductible amount.</br></br>The rationale for the 1954 provision is that it merely puts members of Congress on the same footing as all other taxpayers, who are allowed to deduct uncompensated travel, lodging and other such expenses when away from home on business. The congressmen are also said to be away from ""home,"" by which is meant their districts.</br></br>The trouble is that Washington is in fact where most members principally live. Business trips for them are the trips they regularly take back to their districts. The reason they don't want to make these deductible is that they've already given themselves allowances to cover most of the cost. The allowances are legitimate, but would make a deduction less valuable; it would be redundant.</br></br>A deduction for living costs in Washington has no such disadvantage. It is pure lamb chop; it puts congressmen on a very different footing from all other taxpayers. They can deduct things-the cost of everyday housing, food, the car-that the average citizen cannot."
